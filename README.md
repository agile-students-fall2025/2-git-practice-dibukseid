### AI powered Coding article
[Wired - The AI-powered future of coding is near](https://www.wired.com/ai-powered-coding/)

interesting aritcle that explores how AI-powered coding tools are revolutionizing software dev. It highlights new tools such as SWE-agent
which assist developers in debugging and amending code, making the process entirely more efficient. 
It also discusses the broader implications of AI's rode in coding, and what it means for the evolution of the software engineering role. 
It's interesting to see where AI can go and how it will affect the job market.

Hey this article was pretty interesting! The article I shared was also about AI and the impact it would have on software engineering (its no surprise that dozens of articles on the subject would be coming out given its a shadow hanging over the field at the moment with great uncertainity about its impact). The article I shared was more mixed on the impact of AI so its interesting to see someone be more positive about the subject.
